  ### First Project Proposal Idea

  * A pattern-memory testing game that will primarily use jQuery and a CSS framework, based on this product (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

  Game will consist of at least 4 interactive regions on the page that will light up in a randomized pattern, then allow the user to attempt to recreate that pattern by clicking. If the user is correct a new, longer pattern is generated. This will continue until the user is unable to match the pattern.

  The user's top score could be stored locally.

  **What problem does your project solve?**

  * A simple yet challenging web game that helps improve short term memory.

  **How will your project solve this problem?**

  * By recording the user's top score, they will be able to see how much they have improved

  **What web APIs will it use?**

  * Upon passing a new level the user will see a quote pulled from https://quotesondesign.com/the-api/

  **What technologies will it use?**

  * jQuery/JavaScript
  * Ajax
  * CSS framework (not Bootstrap)

  ### Second Project Proposal Idea

  * A web app that organizes and provides links to guitar or bass tabs/chords derived from either a playlist the user provides or that is generated from a third-party site such as Last.fm or Billboard.

  **What problem does your project solve?**

  * This saves the user from having to search for and compile results for each song individually if they want access to the tabs/chords/lyrics for a list of songs. This would be particularly useful for professional cover bands as all they have to do is input their list of songs to receive a list of links to the chords. Then they can send that list to the rest of the band to update their setlist, or provide the list to a new member so they can get up to speed relatively quickly.

  **How will your project solve this problem?**

  * By automating the process of searching for and storing quality tab/chord sources.

  **What web APIs will it use?**

  * https://www.songsterr.com/a/wa/api/

  * Potentially a third-party API like Billboard (which may not be maintained anymore) or Last.fm.

  **What technologies will it use?**

  * JavaScript/jQuery
  * CSS framework (not bootstrap)
  * Ajax
  * Potentially some JS packages to normalize user inputs
